# DiscordMMORPG

Instead of your local cmd this rpg utilizes the discord chat app as chat bot and allows people around the world to play together, what makes it an MMORPG.
The Discord bot is written in python besides the rpg game engine that is its own package.

Currently is the game engine in version 0.1.
I am working on the patch towards version 0.2, for this i have to test and improve every part of the engine, that takes time.
